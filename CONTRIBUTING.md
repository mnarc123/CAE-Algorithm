# Contributing to CAE Algorithm

First off, thank you for considering contributing to the CAE Algorithm project! It's people like you that make the open-source community such a fantastic place to learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make will benefit everyone using this project and are greatly appreciated.

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it are governed by the CAE Algorithm Code of Conduct. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to mnarcisi.aimaster@proton.me

## How Can I Contribute?

There are many ways you can contribute to the CAE Algorithm, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests, or writing code which can be incorporated into the project itself. Below, you'll find guidance on how you can contribute specifically.

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for the CAE Algorithm. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

**Before Submitting A Bug Report:**

- Check the [Issues](https://github.com/mnarc123/CAE-Algorithm/issues) page to ensure the bug has not already been reported.
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one.

**How Do I Submit A Good Bug Report?**

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). Create an issue and provide the following information:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
- **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as much detail as possible.
- **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples.
- **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
- **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
- **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** if possible, demonstrating the problem.

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for the CAE Algorithm, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality.

**Before Submitting An Enhancement Suggestion:**

- Check the [Issues](https://github.com/mnarc123/CAE-Algorithm/issues) page to see if the enhancement has already been suggested.
- If it hasn't, create a new issue.

**How Do I Submit A Good Enhancement Suggestion?**

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues. Create an issue and provide the following information:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue.
- **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as much detail as possible.
- **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**.
- **Describe the current behavior and how this enhancement would modify that behavior or why this enhancement would be useful.**
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most CAE Algorithm users.

### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain the quality of the CAE Algorithm
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible CAE Algorithm
- Enable a sustainable system for CAE Algorithm maintainers to review contributions

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. Follow all instructions in the template
2. Follow the styleguides
3. After you submit your pull request, verify that all [status checks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-status-checks/) are passing

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

### Python Styleguide

All Python code must adhere to [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

## Additional Notes

Contributions to the CAE Algorithm project must be made under the same license as the project itself.
